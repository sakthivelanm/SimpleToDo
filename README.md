## Notes

This was my first time using Android Studio and Java ever. So there was a learning curve as I wasn't familiar with either the IDE or the language being used, however the video tutorials really helped. I liked how the the activity_main.xml file let me use either the code or the design and it was the first time I've seen something like that. Overall though, this was a really run project to do and I learned so much from this alone.
